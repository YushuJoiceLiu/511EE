# 511EE Simulation Methods for Stochastic Systems
Course Description:
Randomness and uncertainty are an integral part of nature e.g. random variations in weather patterns,
human traffic, stock prices, etc. Stochastic models are important tools for characterizing such random
phenomena. The goal of this course is to examine different methods for simulating stochastic models.
The course will also introduce tests and tools for validating computer models of randomness. 

Course Topics
1) Review of Probability theory: RVs, LLN,CLT, etc
